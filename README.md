# What Is an M3U File?
An M3U file is an Audio Playlist file that stands for MP3 URL, and as such, isn't an actual audio file in and of itself.

An M3U file just points to audio (and sometimes video) files so that a media player can queue them for playback. These text-based files can contain URLs and/or absolute or relative pathnames to the media files and/or folders.

M3U files that are UTF-8 encoded are instead saved in the M3U8 file format.

# How to Open an M3U File
VLC is my favorite free media player because of its support for a huge variety of audio and video formats. Plus, it supports not only the M3U format but also similar playlist file types you may run into, like M3U8, PLS, XSPF, WVX, CONF, ASX, IFO, CUE, and others.

Though Winamp was one of the first programs to support them, other media players can open M3U files too, like 

Windows Media Player, iTunes, and Audacious,VLC,POTPlayer,Televizo and Etc.

Keep in mind that the M3U file itself is not a media file. So while the files that the M3U points to may open just fine in a different media player than those I've linked to above, it's possible that the program can't understand the playlist file, and therefore won't know what to do with it when you try to open it.
M3U files can, of course, be opened with any text editor since the files are text-based.
